# Problem Statement
## Maximize Subsequences In String
You are given two strings, **text** and **pattern**, both consisting of only lowercase English letters. The objective is to modify the text by adding either pattern[0] or pattern[1] exactly once at any position. 

After the modification, you need to determine the maximum number of times the pattern can occur as a subsequence in the modified text.

A subsequence is a sequence of characters obtained by deleting some or no characters from the original sequence without changing the order of the remaining characters.

### Example with Explanation
Input text is “abdcdbc”. Input Pattern is “ac”.  
When inserting 'a' as Pattern [0] between text [1] and text [2], the resulting string is "abadcdbc." After deleting “bd” in the newly created text, we will get “aacc”. In this modified string, the subsequence "ac" appears four times.  

Some other combinations are,  
aabdcdbc -> aacc -> Four times  
abdacdbc -> aacc-> Four times  
abdcadbc -> acac -> Three times  
abdccdbc -> accc -> Three times  
abdcdbcc -> accc -> Three times  

>## Exercise-1
>### Input:
>ababc  
>ab
>### Output:
>5
>## Exercise-2
>### Input:
>ababab  
>ab
>### Output:
>9
