# Problem Statement
## Is Graph Bipartite?
You have an undirected graph with n nodes, each represented by a number between 0 and n - 1. The graph is described by a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array containing nodes adjacent to node u. In other words, there is an undirected edge between node u and each node v present in graph[u]. The graph satisfies the following conditions:  

* There are no self-edges, meaning that node u is not present in graph[u].
* There are no parallel edges, implying that each node appears only once in the adjacency list.
* The graph is undirected, so if node v is adjacent to node u, then node u is also adjacent to node v (i.e., an edge between u and v implies an edge between v and u).
* The graph may not be fully connected, so there can be two nodes u and v such that there is no direct path between them.
* The task is to determine whether the given graph is bipartite or not. A graph is considered bipartite if its nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets, denoted as set A and set B, such that each edge connects a node from set A to a node from set B.
