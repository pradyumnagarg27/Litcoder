# Problem Statement
## Contiguous Array
Given a binary array 'nums', you are required to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.

### Explanation:

* A binary array is an array that contains only 0s and 1s.
* A subarray is any subset of the indices of the original array.
* A contiguous subarray is a subarray in which all the elements are consecutive, i.e., any element between the first and last element of the subarray is also part of it.
### Examples:
Input :nums = [0, 1]  
Output : 2  
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is [0, 1] with a length of 2.  <br/><br/>
Input : nums = [0, 1, 0]  
Output : 2  
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is either [0, 1] or [1, 0], both with a length of 2.  <br/><br/>
Input : nums = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  
Output : 6  
Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] with a length of 6.  <br/><br/>
The problem requires finding the maximum length of a contiguous subarray in the binary array 'nums' that contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.
