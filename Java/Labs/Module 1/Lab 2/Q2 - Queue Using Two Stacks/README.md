# Problem Statement
## Queue Using Two Stacks
Write a program to implement a custom queue using two stacks. The queue should support the following three types of queries:

***Enqueue:*** This query type is denoted by "1 x", where x is an element to be enqueued. It means that you need to insert element x at the end of the queue.

***Dequeue:*** This query type is denoted by "2". It indicates that you should remove the element at the front of the queue.

***Print Front:*** This query type is denoted by "3". It instructs you to print the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
