# Problem Statement
## Sum Of Numbers With Unit Digit K
You are given two integers, num and k. You need to find the minimum possible size of a set of positive integers with the following properties:

Each integer in the set has the unit digit equal to k.  
The sum of all the integers in the set equals num.  
If such a set exists, return its minimum size. Otherwise, if no set satisfies the conditions, return -1.

Note:  
The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and if the set is empty, its sum is considered to be 0.
The unit digit of a number refers to its rightmost digit.

Consider the input:  
num = 58  
k = 9

The function should return 2 because there exists a valid set with two positive integers, both having the units digit 9, and their sum is equal to 58.
